            <ul>
            <li>What part I have paid attention to when I worked on the assignment and I think I did well: I think I did well in terms of pronunciation and accent. For the past two years, I have watched quite a few Japanese TV shows and movies and I believe I pronunciate things based on what I remember hearing from the shows. I also put a lot of effort in making sure the content is based on my own experience. I tried to adapt what we learned in the class to fit my narratives.
            <li>What part I think I could improve: Incorporating more complex sentence structures and using new vocabularies we recently learned in the class. I realized that I did not use new vocabularies from Lesson 8 onward as I am still not familiar with them. I need to practice using these words more often to make them stick. I also acknowledged that my main weakness is on conjugating verbs and adjectives. I still cannot do that naturally and automatically.</li>
            <li>What I have learned from this particular VT assignment, from my peers’ videos, and from feedback from the instructor: This assignment really helped me putting together all I have learned in the class to become conversational. It was much harder than I thought; to get a one-minute video, it took me almost an hour to prepare. It also made me realize that, while I thought I mastered all the grammar points, my speaking skill is still quite lacking. Seeing my peers' videos, I observed different paces and skills everyone has. It was quite motivating that my peers are doing so well and I want to be fluent like them. The instructor's feedback confirms my thought that I need to improve on using more varieties of sentence structures. Her positive feedback, especially on pronunciation and personalized content, made me happy and inspired to further improve.
            <li>Vision and goal for the next assignment: I hope to become more fluent in speaking Japanese, use more varieties of sentence structures and vocabularies, and continue to personalize my responses.</li>
          </ul>

              <li>What part you have paid attention to when you worked on VT2 and you think you did well. (pronunciation, accent, contents, organization, complexity, etc.): I made sure to use more varieties of grammar structures and personalize my response. It was quite a challenge trying to say everything I wanted to say given my limited knowledge of Japanese.</li>
            <li>What part you think you could improve and what you have learned from your peer's videos and from feedback from the instructor: Watching my peer's videos again inspired me to become more fluent and use more adverbs and transition/conjunction phrases.</li>
            <li>Comparing VT1 and VT2, what progress and improvements you can observe: I used more varieties of grammar in VT2.</li>
            <li>What you would like to work on and pay attention to in developing speaking skills in Japanese: I still have to think a lot when speaking, leading to me pausing in random spots or speaking quite slowly. I want to become more fluent so I need to practice more often.</li>
